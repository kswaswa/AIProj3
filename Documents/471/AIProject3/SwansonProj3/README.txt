For my project, you need to install cv2, numpy, scikit-learn(sklearn), pickle, os, and pillow. 

To run my program, take the pickled version and run it. It should prompt you to enter one jpeg. Enter one image of the form 'image.jpg' and make sure it is in the same folder as my program. Then it will predict which of the five classifications your image is.
